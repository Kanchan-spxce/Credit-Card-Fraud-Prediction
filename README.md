Dataset Overview for Credit Card Fraud Prediction

This project aims to analyze transaction data and build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent activities. Using a dataset containing transaction details, we will uncover patterns and factors contributing to fraud and evaluate methods to improve detection accuracy.

The dataset contains 555,719 instances and 22 attributes, covering both categorical and numerical data types. It includes details about cardholders, merchants, transaction amounts, and geolocations. The target variable, is_fraud, indicates whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate, making it an ideal resource for supervised learning and fraud detection analysis.

This dataset provides an opportunity to build models, uncover patterns, and gain insights into factors contributing to fraudulent activities. Its completeness and diversity make it ideal for supervised learning tasks such as classification.
